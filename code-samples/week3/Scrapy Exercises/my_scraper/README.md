# My Scraper

What this does is it scrapes the websiter livingsocial of all the details of their deals and promo. Simpy type:

    scrapy crawl livingsocial
This is to run the app to run and place all the scraped data to our Postgresql database. Also included is a bash script that is placed in the crontab to automate running of app.
