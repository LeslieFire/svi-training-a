#Week 1 Code Samples

* On the [email scraping folder](https://github.com/SiliconValleyInsight/svi-training-a/tree/master/code-samples/week1/email%20scraping), the script shows how to obtain info on emails using the IMAP4 module of Python.

* The [exercises folder](https://github.com/SiliconValleyInsight/svi-training-a/tree/master/code-samples/week1/scraping%20training%20exercises) is just filled with web scraping tests I've done just so I could get a feel on how it works. This includes scraping of the NBA website for the most recent game stats of the cavs and the scraping of all the pictures of the webcomic i'm fond of.
