* [The SVI Email to Calendar Folder](https://github.com/SiliconValleyInsight/svi-training-a/tree/master/code-samples/week4/SVI%20Email%20to%20Calendar) contains the scripts and instructions needed to parse emails from an email client, scrape the data from those emails, place those scraped data inside the database, then calls them in a format that would be understood by the Google Calendar API. 

* [The Scraping Github Folder](https://github.com/SiliconValleyInsight/svi-training-a/tree/master/code-samples/week4/Scraping%20Github) contains a script that sends requests to the Github API.
