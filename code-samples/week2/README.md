# Week 2 Code Samples

*On the [Norvig folder](https://github.com/SiliconValleyInsight/svi-training-a/tree/master/code-samples/week2/Norvig), the script inside is a spelling corrector script written by Peter Norvig but I added comments inside the code so it'll be easier for the next reader to know what is exactly happening. I have also added some comments on some methodologies that he employed which I think is wrong.
